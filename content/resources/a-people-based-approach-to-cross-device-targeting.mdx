Cross-device ad targeting is a digital advertising strategy that allows marketers to reach the same user across their different devices, such as smartphones, connected TVs, laptops, and more. With the increasing number of smart devices in homes and the amount of time people spend using them, it is important for advertisers to be able to reach consumers across multiple devices. Cross-device tracking is used to identify users across different devices and can be done either deterministically or probabilistically. Deterministic cross-device tracking relies on consumer logins as an identifier, while probabilistic cross-device tracking uses models and algorithms to infer whether or not two devices are being used by the same individual based on non-personal data points.

The benefits of cross-device ad targeting include improved ad targeting, increased engagement, and better conversion rates. For example, if a consumer does a search for a product on their smartphone but does not make a purchase, cross-device ad targeting allows the advertiser to serve them a related ad on their desktop computer or connected TV later, potentially leading to a conversion.

In the cannabis industry, advertising can be challenging due to strict regulations and limited access to traditional advertising channels. Cross-device ad targeting can be an effective way for cannabis businesses to reach their target audience and promote their products, as long as they comply with all relevant laws and regulations. For example, a cannabis dispensary could use cross-device ad targeting to serve ads to users who have searched for cannabis products on their smartphone, but only within the legal limits of their state.
